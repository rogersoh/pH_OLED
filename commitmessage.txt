change equation for pH calculation

The previous equation is incorrect as it does not take consideration on the 
summing op-amp in the sensor interface. 
The sensor voltage is calculated as E = Eo - k.T.pH in mV and the output
is thru an summing op-amp to offset the 7 pH to 2V ( the 7pH measure voltage 
at the electrode is 0V while 4pH is 177.48mV at temperature of 25C)
k.T. value at different temperature are:
0 C = -54.2 mV/pH
20 C = -58.2 mV/pH
25 C = -59.2 mV/pH
50 C = -64.1 mV/pH
75 C = -69.1 mV/pH
